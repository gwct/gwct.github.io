            <h2>FASTA format</h2>

                <p>One common format used to store biological sequence data is the FASTA format. Let's take a look at one of the reference sequences stored in FASTA format with the following command:</p>

                <center><pre class="cmd"><code>less -S dmel-3R-reference/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.chromosome.3R.fa</code></pre></center>

                <div class="table-cont">
                    <table class="cmd-table">
                        <thead><th class="tcol-1">Command line parameter</th><th class="tcol-2">Description</th></thead>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">less</td><td class="tcol-2">A Linux text file viewer (use space to scroll down, b to scroll up, and q to exit)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">-S</td><td class="tcol-2">Turn off line-wrapping within less (use the left and right arrow keys to scroll left and right).</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">dmel-3R-reference/Drosophila_melanogaster.BDGP6.28.dna.chromosome.3R.fa</td><td class="tcol-2">The path to the file you want to view</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </div>

                <p>Here I've clipped the top of this output:</p>

                <pre class="text"><code>>3R dna:chromosome chromosome:BDGP6.28:3R:1:32079331:1 REF

GTCCAGTACGGGTCCAGTACGGGTCCAGTACGGGTCCAGTACGGGACCAGTACGGGACCG</code></pre>

                <p>We can see that the first line begins with the greater than symbol (<code class="inline">></code>). This indicates that it is a header line for the following sequence.
                    Header lines can contain whatever information the file creator thought would be important to annotate the sequence. In most cases, it will have a name
                    for the sequence and some information about its location in the genome.</p>

                <p>After the header line comes the sequence. Sequences can be split up to multiple lines, but always form a single string that refers back to the previous header. 
                    There can also be multiple headers/sequences in a single FASTA file.</p>

            <h2>FASTQ format</h2>

                <p>Reads require a different format because they are need to store another important piece of information regarding sequence data: per-base quality scores.
                    To accomplish this, the FASTQ format is used. We can see an example of FASTQ format with the reads provided:</p>

                <center><pre class="cmd"><code>zless -S dpse-2-reads/illumina/pse-chr2_1.fastq.gz</code></pre></center>

                <div class="table-cont">

                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">zless</td><td class="tcol-2">A Linux compressed text file viewer

                                to scroll up, and <code class="inline">q</code> to exit)</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">-S</td><td class="tcol-2">Turn off line-wrapping within <code class="inline">zless</code> 
                                (use the <code class="inline">&lt;left arrow&gt;</code> and <code class="inline">&lt;right arrow&gt;</code> to scroll left and right).</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td class="tcol-1">dpse-2-reads/illumina/pse-chr2_1.fastq.gz</td><td class="tcol-2">The path to the file you want to view</td>
                        </tr>

                <p>Here is what the first few lines of that file should look like:</p>

                <p>So as you can see there's a lot more information here. In FASTQ, lines that start with the at <code class="inline">@</code> character are the header lines and
                    can contain any amount of information about the sequence, including it's ID, information about the sequencing machine that generated it, and whether
                    it is one of a pair of reads. In this case, since these reads were downloaded from the SRA, only an ID and the pair number (<code class="inline">/1</code>)
                    are included. In the snippet above there are two lines starting with <code class="inline">@</code>, meaning we are looking at information for two reads.</p>

                <p>Following the header line are lines that contain sequences corresponding to that header, just like in FASTA formatted files. However, after this
                    is a line that starts with <code class="inline">+</code>. This is a linker line between the sequence and the quality scores. It can be left blank with just the
                    <code class="inline">+</code> sign, or can contain header information as well.
                </p>

                <p>After the linker line are the <b>ASCII encoded Phred-scaled quality scores.</b></p>

            <div id="section_sep_top"></div>
            <div id="section_line"></div>
            <div id="section_sep_btm"></div>

            <h2>Phred quality scores</h2>

                <p>Sequencing machines read sequences as signals such as fluorescence or changes in pH or charge. Many sequencing machines can measure the intensity
                    of these signals and other factors at run-time to assign the probabilty that the base called at each position is an error. These error probabilities
                    are transformed into quality scores as follows:</p>

                <p><span class="math display" id="eqn">\[ Q = -10\log P(error)\]</span></p>

                <p>Scores resulting from this transformation are known as Phred scores because they were first used by the base-calling software Phred and usually range from 0 to 40.</p>

                <p>To encode these scores into FASTQ files, they are converted to an ASCII character. Briefly, starting with the number 33, each character on an English keyboard
                    has a corresponding integer code (called the decimal value or DEC). To convert Phred scores to ASCII characters, we first add 33 to the Phred score and look up that
                    value in the ASCII table.</p>

                <div class="row" id="img-row">
                    <div class="col-4-24" id="margin"></div>
                    <div class="col-16-24" id="img-col">
                        <img id="res-img" src="img/ascii-table.png">
                        <center><span class="fig-caption">Figure 2.1: ASCII table.</span></center>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-4-24" id="margin"></div>
                </div>

                <p>Converting from ASCII characters back to error probabilities is just the reverse of this process. For example, the first ASCII character in the quality strin
                    of the first read above is <code class="inline">A</code>. Looking this up in the table, <code class="inline">A</code> has a DEC value of 65. The corresponding Phred score would then be
                    65 - 33 = 32. And then we convert back to error probability with the reverse of the above equation:
                </p>

                <p><span class="math display" id="eqn">\[ P(error) = 10^{-\frac{Q}{10}} \]</span></p>

                <p>Using this equation, a score of 32 means the probability that this base is called erroneously is 0.00063</p>
